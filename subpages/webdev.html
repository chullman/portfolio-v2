          <h2>Application:</h2>
          <h2>"Bubble Buddies"</h2>
          <p>Likened to the popular group event hosting and organisation platform, "meetup.com", this app was developed from the ground up as a demo/student project to showcase my skills and experience in Rails development. Key phases of the Software Development Lifecycle were conducted and recorded/documented as part of this project.</p>
          <h3>Why did I choose to build this project?</h3>
          <p>
            You may or may not have yet read in my "About Me" page that I love going SCUBA diving, and when diving, you must always dive with someone else next to you at all times underwater, known as a "buddy". From my own personal experience, it's difficult to find buddies sometimes, especially on self-organised trips. Excellent meetup platforms exist such as meetup.com for people to get together in thriving communities. Whilst it's certainly possible to host SCUBA diving meetups on such
            platforms, the interface and functionalities are not tailored specifically for recreational divers and dive instructors to be able to find and get together for the most compatible and tailored SCUBA diving experience. This is the key problem that is intended to be solved with "Bubble Buddies".
          </p>
          <h3>What challenged you when making this project?</h3>
          <p>I had designed an entire relational database schema for Bubble Buddies that would be hosted on PostgreSQL DBMS. However, implementation of the relationships between primary and foreign keys between the databases' tables, as well as implementation of the cardinality of relationships, proved to be confusing when converting my schema into Rails code.</p>
          <h3>How did I get unstuck?</h3>
          <p>For the above challenge I faced, I was being very resourceful and tried to debug it on my own. Without success, to waste no time, I sought assistance from our educator at the time, where I actively demonstrated what I tried so far, and thus we resolved the issue efficiently and with clarity of understanding.</p>
          <h3>What was my process for completing this project?</h3>
          <p>As I was still very much learning Ruby and Rails at the time, I adopted a compartmentalised, "prototype" development approach, with significant resourceful "Google'ing" if time permitted.</p>
          <h3>What would I do differently next time?</h3>
          <p>I would very much make the front-end UI/UX more intuitive, clean and responsive looking. Time-constraints meant I was only able to get the website to MVP before submission. I would also flesh out wireframes in much more detail to help me with the UI creation.</p>

          <h2>Application:</h2>
          <h2>"SAP Dashboard"</h2>
          <p>Designed and purposed with the objective to provide a more "user-friendly" interface for stakeholders to perform data analytics and gather information from select SAP ERP data marts with excellent <span class="bold">User Experience (UX)</span> in mind. Although it is in its prototype stage, the foundational code structure is all in place, ready to be built upon with relative ease with more dashboard functionality.</p>
          <h3>Why did I choose to build this project?</h3>
          <p>
            There was a critical business need that needed to be addressed and resolved as soon as possible; Critical because the business need could've escalated into a physical safety issue if left ignored. The SAP ERP interface made it challenging to gather and analyse the data for Business Intelligence, especially when it involved the exportation of such data onto rudimentary spreadsheets. I needed quickly developed and deployable web interface to gather the data (with help from some
            self-created SQL code to correlate the right data from the data marts), so I proactively chose ASP.NET MVC as the tool of choice, using Bootstrap 3 for rapid front-end development.
          </p>
          <h3>What challenged you when making this project?</h3>
          <p>Display the correlated data on the website as Business Intelligence required a tabular representation of the data for view by the user. I implemented an open-source jQuery template that I heavily modified to show this data, but JavaScript, let alone jQuery, was very confusing to me at the time.</p>
          <h3>How did I get unstuck?</h3>
          <p>Extensive resourceful and efficient "Google'ing" for solutions, as thankfully JavaScript is a very popular language in the world with countless resources available on the internet, and seeking help from an experienced colleague was unfortunately not an option at the time.</p>
          <h3>What was my process for completing this project?</h3>
          <p>Very much got stuck into development. I know this is certainly not software development best practice anywhere in the industry, but it allowed me to get a functional and tested "prototype" web app out at MVP level.</p>
          <h3>What would I do differently next time?</h3>
          <p>Upon reflection now, I realised I was overly ambitious and self-driven. I would've saved a lot of headache if I had just engaged with the company's primary IT SAP team and used third-party software for Business Intelligence visualisation such as Tableau.</p>
