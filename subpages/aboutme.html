                    <h2>So Why Coding and Web Development?</h2>
                    <p>
                        <span class="bold">I’m an IT professional addicted to engineering solutions with code!</span>
                        <br>
                        <br> I graduated from university in 2011 from a regional town in New South Wales, Australia, with a <span class="bold">Bachelor of Information Technology degree</span> where I attained close to a distinction grade average. During my studies, I learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Visual Basic .NET, and C++, where upon reflection I thought, <span class="bold">“wow, how cool is it that something I coded; hand-crafted from scratch using foreign computer syntax, actually works, displays, and could potentially be of value to a user!”.</span>
                        <br>
                        <br> After taking a gap-year from graduation to explore parts of the world (I’m fascinated by different cultures). I was blessed to land a full-time IT job where I transitioned between working with multiple different teams within the IT discipline, and I became an IT “jack-of-all-trades” professional, including a period working in an application developer team role. C# and .NET was the primary tech-stack here I adopted and learnt throughout, developing applications, and even a game application for my own personal hobby in my free time. <span class="bold">That dopamine lift I get when something I engineered is functioning and bug-free is addicting, especially when I know the code base is robust, well architectured, reusable, maintainable and meets the client's requirements.</span>
                        <br>
                        <br> Unfortunately, and resentfully, personal health issues became paramount, and after I exited my full-time IT job, I became directionless in my career because my skills and knowledge in coding, and especially full-stack web development, were not up to scratch to what recruiters and employers in the industry required. I tried with enthusiasm other careers like retail, but couldn’t shake off my curiosity and sentiment for coding. <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="bold">“Coder Academy”</span>, an accredited coding bootcamp to become a full-stack web developer was my saving grace. The course curriculum is practical/hands-on and industry focused, and the chance for a real internship opportunity at the end of the course is the icing on the cake for me. <br>
                        <br> Now as a current Coder Academy student, <span class="bold">I hope to become industry ready and add value to an organisation to add value and help them to reach their goals, and then some!</span>

                            <li> I can’t stress enough how much I love <span class="bold">SCUBA diving!</span> I first trained for and got my entry-level qualification to dive in the open water in a beautiful island and waters off of Thailand, where I also met some wonderful people and made new friends. <br>
                                <br> After arriving back in Australia, I dived very frequently, as long as I could afford to do so, off of NSW and QLD coastlines, including regularly attending a meetup group of like-minded divers. I furthered my training and qualifications to become a current “Rescue” diver; One step away from becoming a trainee “Divemaster” - the first step into becoming a professional diver. Today, I’ve done well over 100 dives! <br>
                                <br> I’ve dived with all sorts of sea and weather conditions, and a huge variety of marine life. From the calm, warm, shallow waters of Thailand with schools of tropical fish, to diving in cold winter waters in Australia in ripping currents, strong swell, and countless menacing looking (but honestly very calm docile) sharks. <br>
                                <br> SCUBA diving is very meditative and thus relaxing to me underwater. You hear nothing but the sounds of your own breathing, and the need to focus on your own breathing patterns to control your air consumption rate and buoyancy underwater to me is meditative on its own, even when surrounded by Gray Nurse sharks!
                            </li>
                            <li> When the typical Queensland heat isn’t feeling oppressive, I love to go <span class="bold">bushwalking and hiking</span>, especially up mountains. Being in nature feels very grounding, and to me, feels like it brings us back to our human roots of the simple life, where it’s just you and your hiking group, the natural elements, and the endorphine lift from the sometimes strenuous exercise and fun of occasionally scrambling up boulders. Of course, the always awesome views at the summit of a mountain is a bonus! </li>
