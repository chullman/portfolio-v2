          <h2>So Why Coding and Web Development?</h2>
          <p>
            <span class="bold">I'm an aspiring IT professional addicted to engineering solutions with code!</span>
            <br />
            <br />
            I graduated from university in 2011 from a regional town in New South Wales, Australia, with a
            <span class="bold">Bachelor of Information Technology degree</span>, where I attained close to a distinction grade average. During these studies, I
            learnt the fundamentals of HTML, CSS, Visual Basic .NET, and C++. Upon reflection, I thought,
            <span class="bold"
              >"cool! Things I code, using foreign computer syntax, actually worked, displayed, and could potentially be of value to a user!"</span
            >.
            <br />
            <br />
            After taking a gap year from graduation to explore parts of the world, I was fortunate to land a full-time IT job as a Graduate Information
            Technologist. Here, I transitioned between working with multiple different teams of varying responsibilities within the IT discipline. I became a
            "jack-of-all-trades" IT professional, so to speak, including software development. C# and .NET were the primary tech-stack I adopted and learnt
            throughout, developing applications and even a game application as a hobby in my free time.
            <span class="bold"
              >That dopamine lift I get when something I engineered is functioning, and bug-free is addicting! Such satisfaction is especially true when I know
              the code base is well-designed, Robust, reusable, maintainable and meets the client's requirements</span
            >.
            <br />
            <br />
            Unfortunately, and resentfully, personal health issues became paramount. So after I exited my full-time IT job, I became directionless in my career
            aspirations because my skills and knowledge in coding, and especially full-stack web development, were not up to scratch. Furthermore, my health
            issues compounded my ability to upskill in coding to industry requirements. Eventually, I tried other non-IT-related careers with enthusiasm, but I
            couldn't shake off my curiosity and sentiment for coding.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span class="bold">"Coder Academy"</span>, an accredited coding bootcamp to become a full-stack web developer, was my saving grace. The course
            curriculum is practical/hands-on and industry-focused, and the chance for a real internship opportunity at the end of the course is the icing on the
            cake for me.
            <br />
            <br />
            Thanks to my studies at Coder Academy,
            <span class="bold"
              >I hope that I am industry ready to add value to an organisation and help organisations and clients reach their goals and then some!</span
            >

                I can't stress enough how much I love <span class="bold">SCUBA diving!</span> I first trained for and got my entry-level qualification to dive
                in the open water on a beautiful island and waters off of Thailand, where I also met some wonderful people and made new friends.
                <br />
                <br />
                After arriving back in Australia, I frequently dived, as long as I could afford to do so, off of NSW and QLD coastlines, including regularly
                attending a meetup group of like-minded divers. I furthered my training and qualifications to become a current "Rescue" diver, one step away
                from becoming a trainee "Divemaster" - the first step into becoming a professional diver. Today, I've done well over 100 dives!
                <br />
                <br />
                I've dived with sea and weather conditions and a wide variety of marine life. From the calm, warm, shallow waters of Thailand with schools of
                tropical fish to diving in cold winter waters in Australia in ripping currents, strong swell, and countless menacing looking (but honestly very
                calm, docile) sharks.
                <br />
                <br />
                SCUBA diving is very meditative and thus relaxing to me underwater. You hear nothing but the sounds of your breathing and the need to focus on
                your breathing patterns to control your air consumption rate and buoyancy underwater, to me is meditative on its own, even when surrounded by
                Gray Nurse sharks!
              </li>
              <br />
              <li>
                When the typical Queensland heat isn't oppressive, I love going <span class="bold">bushwalking and hiking</span>, especially up mountains. Being
                in nature feels very grounding; it brings us back to our human roots. When hiking, it's just you and your hiking group, the natural elements,
                and the endorphin lift from the sometimes strenuous exercise and fun of occasionally scrambling up boulders. Of course, the always fantastic
                views at the summit of a mountain are a bonus!
